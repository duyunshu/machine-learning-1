    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most 50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

   "source": [
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Random Forest (RF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**real-world application:** this model can be used to making predictions on how crowded a place will be given certain conditions like date and time. I used it in one of my research on predicting how crowded my school gym will be: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8428483.\n",
    "\n",
    "**strengths:** easy to build and does not make prior assumptions about data distribution, well suited for real-world data when one has no idea what does the data look like (such as in my paper). From my experience, it works well in de-correlating the features. For example, date and time could be a pair of very correlated features, using RF could break it since some trees could pick only date or only time (plus others) as features to build the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**weaknesses:** From my experience RF does tend to overfit the data, especially when the number of trees grows. The results were not easy to interpret either. I have also used Decision Tree before and I was able to actually draw out the tree and output the rules that it constructs. With RF, the rules are more blurry to observe. \n",
    "\n",
    "**why this model:** I think some of the features here could be correlated, e.g., hours per week vs. occupation. As mentioned in the strengths of RF, it could help break the correlation between features and reduce variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**real-world application:** I do not know any precise applications/products that for sure is using KNN as their model, but I could imagine this being applied in a recommendation system, where there is a need in clustering customers with similar behaviors together. For example, Amazon probably looks into (which I don't know if it's true) different \"types\" of customers and make similar recommendations to groups that are alike. \n",
    "\n",
    "**strengths:** similarly to RF, KNN does not make prior assumptions about data distribution either, which is good in our case that, as for now, our data does not seem to follow a specific distribution shape (this is also the reason I did not choose GaussianNB). KNN is also easy to implement, and fast to train in an online fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "**weaknesses:** first, I think it will be trivial to determine a good distance measurement. Although usually something like Euclidean distance is used, it is not certain if it works for our data. Second, KNN can be problematic in high dimensions---distances become harder to distinguish as dimension gets higher, points could all look very close together (again, the problem of defining a good distance function). Third, KNN could be sensitive to outliers since it is built purely based on the data itself (without any \"training\"), so if outlier (or some new data) occurs, KNN will need to do the fitting again, and results could be entirely different. \n",
    "\n",
    "**why this model:** Although KNN has the above-mentioned weaknesses, I do not think those will hinder the learning problem here: the dimensions are not too high, and there will be no new data occur during training (only that we will use testing data for testing, but that does not change the model). And I think it is important that the model needs no prior distribution assumptions---the main reason I chose both RF and KNN to start with. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Logistic Regression (LR)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**real-world application:** again, not sure of any \"real\" application that definitely uses LR, but taken from the course videos, it can probably be used to, say, decide if a credit card application should be approved? Since what we want for output to be some probability of if a person is qualified for applying for a credit card given some features (and I could imagine those features being numerical such as how much loan does this person own, what's his/her income, etc.). LR limits the results between [0,1], we just need to define a \"threshold\" to decide if the application will be approved or not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**strengths:** as mentioned above, it outputs between [0,1] which is a probability score based on the data, and it will be easy to view/decide the decision boundary (the \"threshold\"). It is also easy to implement since the computation is not very complicated. \n",
    "\n",
    "**weaknesses:** won't work if the data is not linearly-separable since the decision boundary of LR is linear. \n",
    "\n",
    "**why this model:** Though a simple method, LR is suitable for binary classification problems, which is what we have here (<=50k and >50k). We might have the problem that data is non-linear, but we do not have to separate them perfectly---only cares more about classifying people who have income >50k correct---we could probably tolerant a few errors.

    "**Answer:** I think the best model among the three is Logistic Regression (LR). \n",
    "\n",
    "**training/testing time:** It is clear to see that LR takes the shortest amount of time for training and testing, regardless of the sample size. While KNN is the slowest that takes the longest time to train, especially when using the entire data set, it can be seen that it does not scale up well. As for RF, its training/testing time is in between LR and KNN (but much faster than KNN). \n",
    "\n",
    "**metrics:** since I have decided to discard KNN because of its slow training time, let's now compare the metrics for LR and RF. During training, RF obviously does a good job since it's training accuracy reaches almost 100%. However, as discussed in one of the weaknesses of RF, there is an obvious overfit---while the training accuracy is super high, the testing accuracy is much worse. This trend is even more clear to see in f-score when using only 1% of the data, it is high in training but drops a lot during testing (actually the worst among the three). This also shows that our classes are unbalanced that when considering the only accuracy, one can get a good result if most of the inputs get to be classified as \"<=50K\" (the majority of the data). But one gets a low f-score if it failed to predict \">50K\" when it actually is. However, for LR it achieves constantly good training/testing accuracy and f-score---although not necessarily a very high score, which we could further tune it---this means LR was doing well in identifying the actual people who have an income of greater than 50K. \n",
    "\n",
    "**suitability for the data:** I think LR is suitable for our data since we have converted all features into numerical, and we are looking for a threshold to classify income into two categories. Also, we can see from the f-score plot that the more data we use, the better the LR results are. So I think by fine-tuning LR more, we could get a better result in predicting people who might donate to the charity. "

This value is the \"output\" and is ranged between zero and one. Zero means it is not possible for a person to have income >50K therefore not possible to donate, and one means it is very certain that this person has income >50K and is highly likely to donate. \n",

If this probability is larger than a \"threshold,\" say, 0.8, we could say that he/she will be very likely to donate (intuitively it is like the model is 80% sure this person will donate). "

    "**Answer:** The optimized model is just *slightly* better than the unoptimized model (<1% improvement). The best C parameter found after grid search is 0.1 (default: 1) and the best solver is \"newton-cg\" (default: \"liblinear\"). I think this could be attributed to one of the drawbacks about Logistic Regression: the boundary is linear. Since our data has 13 features, it is not easy to find a linear combination between them. \n",

Although one could argue that with this many features and that decision boundaries could be complex so a random forest (or decision tree) could be a better choice, but the problem of overfitting is obvious with tree-based methods, as we saw in the previous section that, during testing, LR outperforms RF. So overall I think a roughly 84% accuracy and nearly 70% F-score (indicating a good precision) can be consider as a good classifier for our problem here. \n",

    "I was not expecting marital-status as an important feature. I think this could have other relations to some cultural background? For example, if in a family only the husband works while the wife stays at home, then the husband would try to earn more money to support the family. Or if both are working, then each person might make less individually (which in our classifier will fall into '<50K') but they will have enough for the family together. But it seems that marital status is impacting one's financial situation much. \n",

I did not list it as one of the top-5 important features because I thought if you have a well-paid job (i.e., workclass or occupation), you could work fewer hours and earn more than other jobs, so the number of working hours does not seem to be a deciding factor to me.

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
